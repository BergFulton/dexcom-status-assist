# dexcom-status-assist
Attempting to create a Siri/Google Assistant voice command for the DexCom Continuous Blood Glucose Monitor App.

# Project Description
The Dexcom App for iPhone/Android provides blood glucose data to users on their smart phone or watch. As of November 30, 2017, there is no way to do "Hey Siri, what's my blood sugar" or "OK Google, what's my blood sugar right now?" and get an answer from the assistant. 

# Problems
Literally, I have no idea what I'm doing here. 

There may also be some data ringfences because we're dealing with biometric data from humans, but I have no idea. 

What technology should I use? Probably Javascript?
